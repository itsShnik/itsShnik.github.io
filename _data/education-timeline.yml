  to:  Nov 2020
  description: Design and development of algorithms for visual object tracking.

  courses:
    - "Implemented deep learning based state of the art networks like DaSiamRPN. DaSiamRPN works at more than 200 FPS when tested on OTB2015 dataset and gives an AUC of more than 0.63 compared to 0.655 as mentioned in the paper"
    - "Devised a new look-ahead approach for processing information from upcoming frames, when tested on KCF, it improves the estimated average overlap (EAO) by more than 5%"
    - "Developed a model based on convolutional feature extractor paired with Kalman filter for search region prediction and a region proposal network for one shot arbitrary object detection to improve results in long term tracking"
    - "Explored and experimented with novel approaches like verification networks and action driven reinforcement learning for object tracking"

  description: Design and development of algorithms for context based question answering.

  courses:
    - "Developed a bidirectional autoencoder based model which uses the information extracted from context with out of reference knowledge to get the softmax probabilities over all the possible answers to a question"
    - "Extracted the edges based relations from commonsense corporas like ConceptNet and NELL"

  tools: [Transformers, Attention Mechanisms, Encoder-Decoder]

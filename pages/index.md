## **About Me**

Hi I'm Nikhil Shah. I am a third-year undergraduate student of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. <br> 
I have really enjoyed my stay at IIT Kharagpur. I am fond of photography (specially Sunsets!) and I often click anything new that I see. In my free time I like to play basketball (contact me for a 1-on-1). Unlike most I do not like to watch movies and TV shows leave apart a few. I'll rather go for a long walk or just sleep or maybe write something (and throw that in trash very soon).<br>

I love to spend time on solving problems, playing kids games on mobile and throwing ball here and there.

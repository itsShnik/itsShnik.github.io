## **About Me**

Hi I'm Nikhil Shah. I am a senior undergraduate student of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. 

I am currently working as a research intern at SHI lab, University of Oregon and at the CERN division at Chinese University of Oregon. I have co-founded a startup called [Frostlabs](https://frostlabs.org), where I am also involved in the ongoing research on visual question answering. 

I am enthusiastic about research in multimodal and embodied machine learning. I love to read about \*nix based operating systems and Vim. I am fond of teaching and I write my blogs on machine learning concepts [here](https://learningturtle.github.io/Blog). 

I have enjoyed my stay at IIT Kharagpur so far. I am fond of photography (specially Sunsets!) and I often click something new that I see. In my free time I like to play basketball. Unlike most of my friends, I do not like to watch movies and TV shows leave apart a few. I'll rather go for a long walk or just sleep.
